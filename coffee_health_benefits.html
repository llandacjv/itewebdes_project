            <p style="font-size: 24px">Here are some of the reasons why you should drink coffee.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>1. Coffee Raises Your Metabolism and Helps You Perform Better Physically</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px">
                <br>
                Studies have shown that drinking coffee can actually raise your metabolism and help you burn fat at a faster rate, thus positively affecting your weight loss. Caffeine does this by stimulating your nervous system, causing it to send signals to your fat cells to break down body fat. <br><br>
                It also has been shown to improve athletic performance and endurance during exercise. <br><br>
                Just these two reasons alone are awesome enough to drink more coffee, especially before heading to the gym!
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>2. Coffee Is a Great Sources of Antioxidants and Essential Nutrients</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px">
                <br>
                Believe it or not, coffee has a lot of nutritional value. It contains a number of essential nutrients, including riboflavin (11% of the RDA), pantothenic acid (6% of the RDA), manganese (3% of the RDA), potassium (3% of the RDA), magnesium (2% of the RDA) and niacin (2% of the RDA)<br><br>
                It’s also a HUGE source of antioxidants, and one of the top sources of antioxidants in the American diet. Antioxidants are substances that prevent or delay cell damage, and they can control how fast you age by fighting free radicals.<br><br>
                Translation…. Coffee makes you pretty and healthy!<br><br>
                So the next time you look at your coffee, remember it’s not just black water, it’s a tasty source of antioxidants and nutrients.

            <h2>3. Coffee Can Help Prevent Diabetes</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px">
                <br>
                Diabetes, an enormous health problem everywhere with over 400 million sufferers, affects about 8% of adults over the age of 18 affected worldwide. <br><br>
                Studies show that people who drink coffee have a significantly lower risk of developing Type II diabetes. In one study, participants with a total daily consumption of at least three cups of coffee reduced the risk of type 2 diabetes by approximately 42%. <br><br>
                If you’re concerned about diabetes, you may want to start including coffee in your diet on a regular basis to improve your chances of preventing it. But make sure to limit the sugar you add and see below for my tips on healthy(er) sweeteners below.<br><br>
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>4. Coffee Can Make You Smarter</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px">
                <br>
                Coffee contains a chemical called caffeine… yes, I know you know that, but did you know that caffeine is central nervous system stimulant?! When you drink coffee, the caffeine travels to the brain where it is responsible for enhancing the firing of the neurons and increasing energy metabolism throughout your brain. <br><br>
                The next time you need to study or take a test, try drinking a cup of coffee beforehand for a little extra mental edge.<br><br>
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>5. May Help Prevent Liver Disease</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px">
                <br>
                Studies have shown that there is an ingredient in coffee that protects against a liver disease called cirrhosis. If you have never heard of cirrhosis before, it a condition where your liver tissue is damaged and replaced with scar tissue. It can develop several ways like from infections, obesity, and other conditions, but especially from drinking too much alcohol. Drinking coffee on a regular basis has been shown to be a natural detox to help protect against the onset of cirrhosis, especially alcoholic cirrhosis.<br><br>
                So while I don’t advocate drinking too much alcohol, I can recommend drinking coffee regularly if you do as a cleansing body detox and to help give your liver a little extra protection.<br><br>
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>6. Coffee May Help Protect Against Heart Disease and Stroke</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px">
                <br>
                There have been studies that show that moderate coffee drinking lowered the risk of coronary heart disease in women.<br><br>
                Research has also shown that higher coffee consumption reduced the risks of cardiovascular disease and stroke.<br><br>
                Obviously, drinking coffee isn’t going to completely eliminate your chances of developing heart disease or having a stroke (you need good diet, lifestyle habits, and good genes as well). But if just adding coffee to your diet helps lower your risks, why not try it?
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>7. Caffeine May Lower Skin Cancer Risk</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px">
                <br>
                A study by the National Institute of Health found that higher coffee intake was associated with a modest decrease in risk of a certain type of skin cancer called melanoma.<br><br>
                If you’re concerned about your risk of skin cancer, try adding a few cups of coffee to your diet to help lower your risks. And don’t forget your SPF while you’re at it!<br><br>
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>8. Caffeine Can Help Protect You From Dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px">
                <br>
                Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a type of disease that causes problems with your memory, thinking and behavior. Symptoms usually develop slowly and get worse over time, becoming severe enough to eventually interfere with daily tasks. If you’ve ever know somebody with AD or dementia, you know how devastating this condition can be, not just on the sufferer but to those around them as well.<br><br>
                Research has found that drinking 3-5 cups per day while in your middle aged years was associated with a decreased risk of Alzheimer’s and dementia by about 65% in your later years.<br><br>
                Did you get that?? A 65% reduction in your chances of developing dementia by drinking 3-5 cups of coffee a day! That is one of the most compelling arguments in favor of drinking coffee every day that’s I’ve even heard, especially if you’re in your 40’s and 50’s.
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>9. Coffee May Help Reduce Parkinson’s Disease Symptoms</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px">
                <br>
                Parkinson’s disease is a chronic disorder that involves the malfunction and death of certain nerve cells in the brain (neurons). It’s a progressive disease, meaning that symptoms get worse over time. The cause is unknown, and there is no cure.<br><br>
                Worldwide, nearly 7 million people are living with Parkinson’s disease.<br><br>
                Studies have shown that higher coffee and caffeine intake is associated with a significantly lower incidence of Parkinson’s Disease.<br><br>
                This benefit, along with the reduction in AD and dementia, make coffee an important part of your strategy to get older without losing your mental strength and clarity.
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>10. Coffee May Lower Your Risk of Being Depressed</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px">
                <br>
                Depression is a chronic and serious mood disorder that affects twice as many women as men. It causes severe symptoms that affect how you think, feel, and deal with day to day activities like sleeping, eating, or working. Approximately 20% of women will be affected by depression during their lifetime.<br><br>
                Studies have found that increased coffee consumption decreased the risk of depression.<br><br>
                It’s not entirely clear why this occurs, but it’s another great reason to drink coffee! So next time you’re “blue” treat yourself to a cup and if possible some nature and sunshine… which also helps reduce depression!
