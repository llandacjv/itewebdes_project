           	<p>&nbsp;</p>
        	<p style="font-size: 28px">Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, which are the seeds of berries from the Coffea plant.</p>
        	<p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3 style="font-size: 32px">Etymology</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
        	<p style="font-size: 25px">"drink made from the ground and roasted seeds of a tree originally native to Arabia and Abyssinia," c. 1600, from Italian caffe, from Turkish kahveh, from Arabic qahwah "coffee," said originally to have meant "wine," but perhaps rather from the Kaffa region of Ethiopia, a home of the plant (coffee in Kaffa is called buno, which itself was borrowed into Arabic as bunn "raw coffee"). Much initial diversity of spelling in earliest English use, including chaoua (1598).</p>
        	<p>&nbsp;</p>
        	<h3 style="font-size: 32px">Processing</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="font-size: 22px">Irrespective of the harvesting method, green coffee beans and overripe coffee cherries inevitably end up mixed with the perfectly ripe cherries and must be separated during coffee processing.   Overripe coffee cherries, undeveloped coffee cherries, sticks and leaves float in water.  Ripe coffee beans and green coffee cherries are dense and sink.  Therefore, the first step in coffee production consists of separating the "floaters" from the "sinkers."  The coffee floaters are usually sent directly to the patio to be dried and are often slated for internal consumption.  The ripe and green cherries can be sent to the patios to be dried using the natural process of preparing coffee or can be sent to the coffee pulping machines.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h4 style="font-size: 22px">Coffee Processing Equipments</h4>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="font-size: 22px">The first stage of coffee pulping is used to remove the green coffee cherries from the ripe cherries.  In the coffee pulping machinery, the internal pressure is monitored to push the coffee against a screen with holes only large enough for a coffee bean (not cherry) to pass through.  Since the ripe cherries are soft, they break and the coffee seed is released through the screen.  </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h4 style="font-size: 22px">Pulping Coffee</h4>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="font-size: 22px">The green cherries are hard and cannot be pulped.  Instead of passing through the screen, the green coffee beans pass to the end of the barrel system and are separated from the ripe coffee beans.  The pressure inside the barrel controls how many cherries will be pulped.  A very high pressure will cause all of the cherries including the green beans to be pulped.  It is necessary to continuously monitor the pressure so that about 3% of ripe cherries are not pulped and are removed with the green cherries.  This margin of error ensures that no green cherries are mistakenly pulped.  The pulp and coffee beans are then separated by centrifugal force and a barrel screen system.   </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h4 style="font-size: 22px">Coffee Fermentation</h4>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="font-size: 22px">The coffee beans covered in the slippery mucilage can be sent to the patios to dry as pulped natural coffees or can be sent to coffee fermentation tanks.  The coffee fermentation tanks are used to remove the mucilage before drying.  The pulped coffee beans are put into cement tanks with water and are allowed to ferment for 16-36 hours.  On the way to the fermentation tanks, another density separation can occur.  The highest quality coffees are the densest and should be separated and fermented in a different tank. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h4 style="font-size: 22px">Coffee Drying</h4>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="font-size: 22px">From the coffee fermentation tanks, the beans are moved to drying patios and dried to 11-12% moisture content.  See coffee drying section for more details.  A small portion of the lot is hulled and milled by a mini-huller.  Three hundred grams of coffee is classified for defects (100 grams is often used), and the percentage of each screen size is determined.  Then, 200-300 grams of coffee is roasted in a sample roaster and cupped to determine coffee quality.  Ideally no lots will be mixed until the coffee has been classified and cupped.  The coffee remains in pergamino until shipment time to help protect the flavor and aroma of the coffee. </p>
